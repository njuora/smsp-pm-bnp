# smsp-pm-bnp

Authors: Aiyue Fei, Qian Hu, Ying Liu

## Research problem

The single machine scheduling problem with periodic maintenance

## Methodology

1. we first propose a set partitioning model for the problem
1. we then develop a branch-and-price algorithm to solve set partitioning model 

## Data

1. `Instances` fold contains all 1400 benchmark instances.
1. `Solutions` fold contains detailed solutions for each individual instance obtained by the BNP algorithm.
1. the sheet `smsp-pm-result` reports a summary of results of different algorithms.
